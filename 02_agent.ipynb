This latest round pushes the company’s total funding to $225 million since it was founded seven years ago.\\nTuring has been on a strong growth trajectory, hitting $167 million in annualized revenue run rate (ARR) at the time of pricing. The company is now bringing in around $300 million in ARR and has been profitable for about a year, according to CEO Jonathan Siddharth. The funding will help scale R&D, sales, and marketing as the company looks to expand its reach and offerings.\\nFrom HR Tech to AI Partner\\nFounded in 2018, Turing started out as an HR tech company, building a platform to vet and hire remote engineers. The service took off during the pandemic when companies scrambled for better ways to manage remote teams. It didn’t take long for Turing to gain attention, attracting both investors and enterprise clients.\\nThe shift into AI wasn’t part of the original plan, but an unexpected meeting in 2022 changed that. OpenAI invited Siddharth to discuss recruiting engineers, but instead, they had a different proposition. Researchers had discovered that code integrated into training datasets helped improve reasoning in AI models, and they wanted Turing to help generate that data. That request sparked a new business line, turning Turing into a key partner for AI labs and companies working with large language models (LLMs).\\nToday, the startup collaborates with thousands of engineers to support AI development, helping build LLMs for OpenAI and others while creating generative AI applications for enterprises.\\nTuring’s AI Business\\nTuring has expanded its focus into two key areas, each playing a distinct role in shaping the future of AI.\\nThe first, Turing AGI Advancement, collaborates with leading AI labs to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence. The company works to refine AI models’ ability to think, reason, code, and adapt to complex tasks. Its efforts extend into areas like agentic behavior, multimodal processing, STEM knowledge, and other advanced capabilities that define next-generation AI.\\nThe second, Turing Intelligence, takes these advancements and turns them into practical solutions for businesses. By leveraging the latest breakthroughs, Turing helps Fortune 500 companies integrate AI into their operations, developing applications that address real-world challenges and drive efficiency.\\nTogether, these two divisions position Turing at the forefront of both AI research and enterprise adoption, ensuring that technological progress translates into tangible impact.\\nThe company relies on ALAN, its fine-tuning and reinforcement learning platform, which helps optimize AI model evaluations, training, and development. This approach allows Turing to improve AI systems while benefiting from the technology it helps create.\\nBetting on AI’s Future\\nAs AI companies push for smarter, more capable models, the demand for high-quality training data is surging. At the same time, lower inference costs and improvements in AI accessibility are making adoption easier for businesses. Turing is positioning itself at the intersection of these trends, working to advance AI models while turning that research into tools companies can actually use.\\n“Our goal is to accelerate AGI advancement and build AI systems with real-world impact,” said Jonathan Siddharth. “We’ve built a suite of products on top of the world’s largest talent cloud to improve AI models and deploy applications at scale. This Series E round underscores the confidence our investors have in our role in shaping the future of AI.”\\nTuring’s rise in the AI industry hasn’t gone unnoticed.

Turing, which works with armies of engineers to contribute code to AI projects — including assisting in the building of LLMs for OpenAI and others, as well as creating generative AI apps for enterprises — has secured a $111 million Series E round, doubling its valuation to $2.2 billion.\\nTuring currently generates around $300 million in ARR (annualized revenue run rate), and when this latest round was priced, it stood at $167 million. That means the company is growing fast. It has also been profitable for around a year, according to CEO Jonathan Siddharth, who tells TechCrunch the company plans to use the funding to expand its business to more customers and broaden its use cases.\\nTuring today says that it works with some 4 million coders around the world. The actual number of Turing employees is much smaller — it’s a figure in the hundreds, one of its investors said.\\nMalaysia’s sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Berhad is leading the new round, with participation also from WestBridge Capital, Sozo Ventures, UpHonest Capital, AltaIR Capital, Amino Capital, Plug and Play, MVP Ventures, Fortius Ventures, Gaingels, and Mastodon Capital Management. Palo Alto-based Turing has raised $225 million to date.\\nTuring’s turn as a major partner to AI companies was not how the company got its start. Originally, it was effectively an HR tech startup.\\nSpecifically, its early product was a platform for vetting and hiring remote coders, a business that started to take off during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the world sought better tools to source and manage remote teams. That business was strong enough to catapult the company to “unicorn” status, impressing both customers and investors.\\n“When I first met them in 2018 my jaw dropped,” Sumir Chadha, a co-founder and managing partner at WestBridge, said in an interview, referring to how Siddharth seemingly upended the whole management consultancy and offshoring model. “You don’t need any of that. You don’t even need an HR staff. You can do it all with Turing and remote engineers.”\\nIt was also strong enough to start catching a different kind of attention.\\nAs a Semafor report from last year recounts, Siddharth was summoned in 2022 to OpenAI for a meeting, which he thought would be to talk about recruiting engineers for the startup. Instead, it turned out to be a proposition. OpenAI researchers had discovered that code added into training datasets helped improve the model’s reasoning capabilities, and it wanted Turing’s help to generate that code.\\nSiddharth obliged and that set off a whole new business focus for the startup, which he says now works with a number of foundational AI companies to provide similar services, as well as with companies that build apps on top of those LLMs.\\n“We could not have predicted the ChatGPT moment,” he said this week, and he couldn’t have predicted how the infrastructure he built for hiring coders would place Turing itself into the middle of the action. “I don’t think people knew how important software engineering tokens [would be] to teach an LLM to think and reason and code.”\\nBut it hasn’t been a pivot. Siddharth was quick to correct me when I used the word, and he pointed out that Turing still generates substantial revenue from its older business sourcing coding talent, although he would not disclose how much.\\n“They are all growing,” he said of the different business lines. “We are stepping on the gas to scale up R&D, and scale up sales and marketing across all three businesses. We are in rapid expansion mode.”\\nHowever, the main focus in terms of new business, it seems, will be to continue doubling down on its work in AI as a coding provider for the building of future LLMs — a division Turing optimistically calls “Turing AGI Advancement” — and in its work on apps and services built on those LLMs — under the banner of “Turing Intelligence.”\\nUpdated to include a more recent ARR figure.\\nTopics\\nAI, coding assistant, Fundraising, Khazanah Nasional Berhad, LLMs, OpenAI, Startups, turing\\n\\n\\nIngrid Lunden\\nEurope Editor\\n\\nIngrid is a writer and editor for TechCrunch, joining February 2012, based out of London.\\nBefore TechCrunch, Ingrid worked at paidContent.org, where she was a staff writer, and has in the past also written freelance regularly for other publications such as the Financial Times.

Turing, which works with armies of engineers to contribute code to AI projects — including assisting in the building of LLMs for OpenAI and others, as well as creating generative AI apps for enterprises — has secured a $111 million Series E round, doubling its valuation to $2.2 billion.\\nTuring currently generates around $300 million in ARR (annualized revenue run rate), and when this latest round was priced, it stood at $167 million. That means the company is growing fast. It has also been profitable for around a year, according to CEO Jonathan Siddharth, who tells TechCrunch the company plans to use the funding to expand its business to more customers and broaden its use cases.\\nTuring today says that it works with some 4 million coders around the world. The actual number of Turing employees is much smaller — it’s a figure in the hundreds, one of its investors said.\\nMalaysia’s sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Berhad is leading the new round, with participation also from WestBridge Capital, Sozo Ventures, UpHonest Capital, AltaIR Capital, Amino Capital, Plug and Play, MVP Ventures, Fortius Ventures, Gaingels, and Mastodon Capital Management. Palo Alto-based Turing has raised $225 million to date.\\nTuring’s turn as a major partner to AI companies was not how the company got its start. Originally, it was effectively an HR tech startup.\\nSpecifically, its early product was a platform for vetting and hiring remote coders, a business that started to take off during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the world sought better tools to source and manage remote teams. That business was strong enough to catapult the company to “unicorn” status, impressing both customers and investors.\\n“When I first met them in 2018 my jaw dropped,” Sumir Chadha, a co-founder and managing partner at WestBridge, said in an interview, referring to how Siddharth seemingly upended the whole management consultancy and offshoring model. “You don’t need any of that. You don’t even need an HR staff. You can do it all with Turing and remote engineers.”\\nIt was also strong enough to start catching a different kind of attention.\\nAs a Semafor report from last year recounts, Siddharth was summoned in 2022 to OpenAI for a meeting, which he thought would be to talk about recruiting engineers for the startup. Instead, it turned out to be a proposition. OpenAI researchers had discovered that code added into training datasets helped improve the model’s reasoning capabilities, and it wanted Turing’s help to generate that code.\\nSiddharth obliged and that set off a whole new business focus for the startup, which he says now works with a number of foundational AI companies to provide similar services, as well as with companies that build apps on top of those LLMs.\\n“We could not have predicted the ChatGPT moment,” he said this week, and he couldn’t have predicted how the infrastructure he built for hiring coders would place Turing itself into the middle of the action. “I don’t think people knew how important software engineering tokens [would be] to teach an LLM to think and reason and code.”\\nBut it hasn’t been a pivot. Siddharth was quick to correct me when I used the word, and he pointed out that Turing still generates substantial revenue from its older business sourcing coding talent, although he would not disclose how much.\\n“They are all growing,” he said of the different business lines. “We are stepping on the gas to scale up R&D, and scale up sales and marketing across all three businesses. We are in rapid expansion mode.”\\nHowever, the main focus in terms of new business, it seems, will be to continue doubling down on its work in AI as a coding provider for the building of future LLMs — a division Turing optimistically calls “Turing AGI Advancement” — and in its work on apps and services built on those LLMs — under the banner of “Turing Intelligence.”\\nUpdated to include a more recent ARR figure.\\nTopics\\nAI, coding assistant, Fundraising, Khazanah Nasional Berhad, LLMs, OpenAI, Startups, turing\\n\\n\\nIngrid Lunden\\nEurope Editor\\n\\nIngrid is a writer and editor for TechCrunch, joining February 2012, based out of London.\\nBefore TechCrunch, Ingrid worked at paidContent.org, where she was a staff writer, and has in the past also written freelance regularly for other publications such as the Financial Times.

Index.dev has you covered. We offer a global talent network of 14,000 vetted engineering talent, ready to join your team. Hire 7x faster →\\n\\n\\n\\nHow to Choose the Best Platform for Your Needs\\n\\nChoosing the right platform is key to finding the best talent for your project. Here are some simple tips to help you pick one that fits your technical needs and supports your team’s growth:\\n\\n1. Define What You Need\\n\\nStart by clearly outlining your project requirements. Think about the programming languages, tools, and skills that are essential. Do you need a front-end developer, a back-end expert, or both? Decide what level of experience and soft skills are important to you. This will help you narrow down your options.\\n\\n2. Consider Your Budget\\n\\nCompare the costs of different platforms and see how they fit your budget. Some offer premium talent at a higher price, while others are more affordable. Make sure you understand if there are any upfront costs or long-term commitments. Check how payments are structured—whether they charge hourly or per project. Also, consider if the platform's pricing can scale as your project grows.\\n\\n3. Decide on the Scope\\n\\nThink about whether you need a single developer or a whole team. If you’re working on smaller updates or need specific expertise, an individual might be enough. But for more complex projects, like building enterprise-level software or AI systems, you may need a full team, including designers, project managers, and testers.\\n\\n4. Evaluate Flexibility\\n\\nFlexibility is important. Choose a platform that matches the duration of your project. Do you need someone for a few weeks or a long-term team? Check if you can easily adjust or cancel contracts without penalties. If your project grows, make sure the platform can quickly add more talent or scale from a single developer to a full team.\\n\\n5. Check Security and IP Protection\\n\\nMake sure your ideas and code are safe. Look for platforms that take security seriously, using encryption and strong access controls. Ensure they comply with standards like GDPR or ISO. Developers should also sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to protect your project. Once your project is done, all the code and designs should belong to you, not the platform.\\n\\n6. Assess Communication and Time Zones\\n\\nGood communication is key to a smooth project. Make sure the developers or teams are in time zones that allow for real-time collaboration. Check if the platform supports communication tools like Slack or Zoom. Ensure there’s enough overlap in work hours so that any issues or changes can be addressed quickly.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhich Alternative Best Fits You?\\n\\nAs demonstrated, each of the above-mentioned platforms offers distinct features suitable for different requirements.

The company\\'s Imagine-Deliver-Run (IDR) framework provides complete, end-to-end solutions in the uptake, implementation, and management of AI, cloud computing, and application engineering, tailored to meet the specific tech talent and innovation demands of modern enterprises.\\nApplied and honed within its own business operations over the last four years and evolved from the company\\'s Teams offering that provides entire technology teams vetted through its AI-powered Talent Cloud, Turing\\'s IDR methodology was a central factor in the company\\'s triple-digit YoY growth in 2022. In addition to successfully applying the new framework to its own business, Turing applied its IDR approach with several leading companies across AI, healthcare, financial services, and software & hardware services, to solve a range of complex technical challenges with unmatched speed, quality, and cost-efficiency. Case studies demonstrating the success of Turing Services can be found at\\xa0https://www.turing.com/services.\\nTuring Services provides a framework for solution success across the following practice areas\\nArtificial Intelligence\\xa0Help enterprises leverage AI to transform their businessesCloud ComputingBuild, operate, manage, and maintain optimal cloud environmentApplication EngineeringDesign, prototype, and produce the ideal application-Implementation-Strategy & Readiness-Portfolio RationalizationStrategy-Platform Assessment-Assessment-Data Engineering-Migration-Modernization & Migration-ML Model-FoundationAssessment-Development-Security-Design-ML Operations-Cloud-Native Application-Web & Mobile Development\\xa0Development-CX/UI/UX Development\\xa0-DevOps Implementation-Maintenance & Support\\xa0-Platform Maintenance\\xa0\\n\"Conventional technology services fall short of meeting the speed, quality, and overall cost-efficiency requirements of today\\'s fiercely competitive business landscape, which has been further compounded by cutbacks, budgetary constraints, and the incessant shortage of high-caliber tech talent,\" said Jonathan Siddharth, Turing\\'s CEO and Co-Founder. \"With Turing Services, we have introduced an AI-powered approach that offers the best engineering team, vetted and matched by AI, for a company\\'s product roadmap. Our solutions experts have a proven track record of scaling some of today\\'s most iconic technology companies. Our official launch of Turing Services represents a significant advancement over antiquated services models and a new age in tech consulting.\"\\nThe launch of Turing Services comes on the heels of Turing\\'s successful 2022, a year in which the company experienced triple-digit YoY growth and the build-out of its world-class executive roster, while numerous tech companies were hampered by financial constraints, slowed growth, and a focus on business continuity versus innovation.

In great company with the likes of Asana, Atlassian, Gitlab, Slack, and Zoom, Turing defines itself as an international hiring platform that brings together remote software developers and leverages their unique AI vetting process to match the right teams with projects.\\nI met with Jonathan Siddharth, founder and CEO of Turing, to dive into his AI-powered tech services platform and his vision to unleash the world’s untapped human potential.\\nWhat catalyzed the birth of Turing came from the realization that traditional tech service firms were ill-equipped for the AI-driven era. Companies like Accenture continue to do manual sourcing, vetting of talent, manual matching. Turing is changing all this. According to Siddharth,\\n“We believe AI transformation is the new digital transformation. Every company is going to have to be an AI company and I\\'m sure you\\'re hearing the same where every company now needs an AI strategy. Every product is now an AI product. Every role is being transformed by AI. At Turing, we started the company because traditional tech services firms were simply not built for this. They continue to lack the efficiency that AI can bring. Turing is tech services reimagined from the ground up as an AI company. So, we asked ourselves, what would an AI powered Accenture look like?”\\nPROMOTED\\nIn 2020, at a time when the Pandemic mandated the move to remote work, Turing raised $32million in Series B funding with an ambitious plan to “help define the future of how companies source IT talent to grow.” Since 2018, the company has amassed a database of over 2 million engineers from over 150 countries with “approximately 100 or so engineering skills, including React, Node, Python, Agular, Swift, Android, Java, Rails, Golang, PHP, Vue, DevOps, machine learning, data engineering and more.”\\nSiddharth described how they uniquely transform and deliver this AI-powered Accenture. They leverage AI to autonomously identify, evaluate, and align suitable talent with corresponding opportunities. Secondly, they built Turing GPT, to accelerate the productivity of a software engineering team. As per Siddharth, “We combined that with our team of AI transformation experts who help companies in their transformation journey.” With a client list like Disney, Pepsi, Dell, Reddit, Volvo and Rivian, they can leverage Turing’s pre-vetted engineering talent for 1) staff augmentation, 2) custom projects designed to meet temporal requirements 3) and AI advisory services to assists companies in shaping their AI strategy and roadmap.\\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR\\n\\nBest Travel Insurance Companies\\nBy Amy Danise, Editor\\n\\nBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance Plans\\nBy Amy Danise, Editor\\nThese operations are built over top of the Turing Talent Cloud—an expansive pool of over two million developers and growing, they claim as the world’s largest developer- focused database. This resource pool, combined with AI algorithms, streamlines the process of talent acquisition—sourcing, vetting, and aligning them with the right companies.\\nDailyDozen\\nUS\\nForbes Daily: Join over 1 million Forbes Daily subscribers and get our best stories, exclusive reporting and essential analysis of the day’s news in your inbox every weekday.\\nSign Up\\nBy signing up, you agree to receive this newsletter, other updates about Forbes and its affiliates’ offerings, our Terms of Service (including resolving disputes on an individual basis via arbitration), and you acknowledge our Privacy Statement.

Enjoy the Daily!\\nMore Newsletters\\nGrowing up in Chennai, India, Jonathan Siddharth\\'s affinity for innovation became evident early on. He shared, \"I was always fascinated by the ‘new’... I published my first research paper in AI when I was in my sophomore year, 2002. I wrote about using neural networks for self-driving cars.\" After finishing college, he continued his AI research and pursued his Ph.D. at Stanford, which was already ahead in Autonomous Driving. It was there that Siddharth crossed paths with his, now, cofounder, Vijay Krishan, CTO of Turing. “We both got bitten by the startup bug and we started company #1, which was an AI powered content recommendation company.”\\nThe Spark in Finding Talent Outside of Silicon Valley\\nFrom this experience, they found it difficult recruiting great engineering talent. At the time they were at the heart of Silicon Valley, in Palo Alto, where they were fighting for the same limited talent pool as Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and Facebook. Out of necessity, they looked beyond Silicon Valley’s caliber of talent. “It was one of the best things we did”. That was 2012 and it was a move that demonstrated the potential for remote work long before it would bring to bear in 2020. “We were fortunate to work with some wonderful engineers from Poland, Canada, India, China and other parts of the world. And that was really the key to making the company successful. So, my first startup succeeded because of remote work in distributed teams.”\\nFollowing the acquisition of his first venture, Siddharth reflected on the persistent challenge they had conquered. \"Afterwards, I took some time off to figure out what do next, and it became clear that this problem that we had solved for ourselves in my first startup was such a big unsolved opportunity.\"\\nThis realization laid the foundation for the inception of Turing in 2018, with the goal of building this AI powered tech services company “where both Fortune 500 companies as well as startups could push a button to spin up their engineering team instantly.”\\nReflecting on Turing\\'s trajectory, Jonathan acknowledged the factors that have propelled the company\\'s growth. \"With AI being used for automatically vetting engineering talent, matching them, we are thinking about ways to use AI to increase the productivity of a software engineering team. I just feel fortunate that Turing benefited from 2 tailwinds. The first was the tailwinds around remote work and now it\\'s the tailwinds around AI.\\nOptimizing Engineering Teams: Turing\\'s Paradigm of Flexibility and Efficiency\\nTo be clear, Turing is not a recruiting company. The database of engineers are contractors loaned out for staffing or project needs. Does Siddharth believe there is a market to place typically higher-demanded software engineers for temporary projects vs. allowing companies to hire them outright?\\nSiddharth sees a shift in demand today, \"So, my view is that the best way to build a tech company today is for 20 to 40% of your engineering headcount to be powered by long-term full-time contractors like from a platform like Turing. I wouldn\\'t say you should do that for 100% of your engineering headcount, but 20 to 40% and there are some studies that say that it should maybe even be 50%.\"\\nHe highlighted the importance of speed and flexibility and the advantages from Turing’s approach: \"Imagine you were building an AI company like a Copilot for example. Let\\'s say you wanted to build like an iPhone app and Android app and a web app. Now, the old way of doing that would mean you have a budget for one engineer... that would build all three in sequence.\"\\nHe explained there is a better way that provides an organization exactly what they need: “But you don\\'t have to do that anymore. You could come to Turing and say, \\'I\\'m going to need to launch this on iOS, Android and the web.’ So, you\\'ll take three engineers from Turing\\'s talent cloud. They’ll building all three in parallel.\"\\nThis speed to market advantage allows the organization to apply resources only where they’re needed. Assume that once all three applications have been launched and the company decides the iOS app has achieved product market fit, therefore they will move more resources towards further developing that product with a backend engineer and simultaneously, wind down development on the web and Android app. This exemplifies the agility that Turing provides to scale up and scale down engineering teams as easily, effectively foregoing the cost of hiring, training and firing if they were to be employed directly by the organization.\\nSiddharth elaborated on their recent growth and their trajectory:\\nWith their most recent funding round, Turing has secured a valuation cap of four billion dollars. Their prior funding round resulted in a post valuation of 1.1 billion dollars. Cumulatively, Turing has raised approximately 144 million dollars and has achieved unicorn status.\\nSiddharth explains these funds are earmarked primarily for expansion in enhancing their AI-powered vetting and matching engine, with a concentrated effort on research and development. An upcoming endeavor is the development of an AI-powered self-service system that allows individuals to construct their engineering teams through interactive consultations with Turing.\\nSiddharth describes the company’s impact: \"The Turing team functions as a unit supercharged by an AI-powered exoskeleton.” With further sales and marketing efforts they are poised to build this AI-powered Accenture and take on their rival which has had the benefit of tenure and success.\\nReflecting on the Engineering of the Future\\nThe changing landscape for technology towards general AI will emerge the need for engineers to learn new languages and to adapt to disruptive environments that will reveal themselves in greater frequency. What will the role of the engineer look like in the next decade?\\nSiddharth responded with enthusiasm, stating, \"Absolutely, there has never been a more opportune time to pursue a career in software engineering or computer science.\" He suggested that computer science and AI education should be incorporated at the middle school level, alongside subjects like English and mathematics and advocated for introducing AI education at this stage given its growing relevance.\\nSiddharth emphasized a significant shift in the value proposition for software engineers. \"The return on investment (ROI) for becoming a software engineer has now multiplied by 10,\" he asserted. He attributed this dramatic increase to the projected 10-fold boost in software engineers\\' productivity. This expected surge in productivity, according to Siddharth, will pave the way for a surge in entrepreneurial endeavors over the coming years.\\nReflecting on the evolution of the startup, Siddharth recalled that a decade ago, startups often required a seasoned and skilled engineer alongside business experts. However, contemporary technological advancements such as AI-assisted tools enable a broader range of professionals to initiate startups. “Let\\'s say there is a talented journalist. She could start her AI company standing on the shoulders of some of these AI assisted tools.”\\nHe foresees an accelerated growth path for junior engineers, positing that they could attain mid-level engineer proficiency in a shorter span. \"Our head of engineering feels a mid-level engineer can now operate at the level of a senior engineer. AI is just going to amplify the productivity of everyone, and the key to all of this is everyone learning AI.”\\nSiddharth emphasized the importance of widespread AI education. He advocated for individuals acquiring at least a basic understanding of AI, as it is becoming a requisite for almost every job. He envisaged a future where AI integration is ubiquitous and diverse roles are infused with AI elements.\\nAnticipating the growth of AI\\'s potential, Siddharth expressed excitement about the continuous advancement of AI tools. He cited Turing\\'s own experience, noting a 30% increase in productivity using AI-accelerated tools. Jonathan Siddharth is optimistic as he looks forward to the transformative possibilities that AI holds for industries and professions.\\nOnly time will tell whether the broader enterprise market is ready to move towards the newly built Turing paradigm. In the meantime, this company has slowly paved the way to streamline the process of talent discovery, evaluation and alignment that has the potential to reimagine the power of remote engineering teams.\\nFollow me on\\xa0LinkedIn.\\xa0Check out\\xa0my\\xa0website or some of my other work.\\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades\\nJoin The Conversation\\nComments\\n0\\nOne Community.

This latest round pushes the company’s total funding to $225 million since it was founded seven years ago.\\nTuring has been on a strong growth trajectory, hitting $167 million in annualized revenue run rate (ARR) at the time of pricing. The company is now bringing in around $300 million in ARR and has been profitable for about a year, according to CEO Jonathan Siddharth. The funding will help scale R&D, sales, and marketing as the company looks to expand its reach and offerings.\\nFrom HR Tech to AI Partner\\nFounded in 2018, Turing started out as an HR tech company, building a platform to vet and hire remote engineers. The service took off during the pandemic when companies scrambled for better ways to manage remote teams. It didn’t take long for Turing to gain attention, attracting both investors and enterprise clients.\\nThe shift into AI wasn’t part of the original plan, but an unexpected meeting in 2022 changed that. OpenAI invited Siddharth to discuss recruiting engineers, but instead, they had a different proposition. Researchers had discovered that code integrated into training datasets helped improve reasoning in AI models, and they wanted Turing to help generate that data. That request sparked a new business line, turning Turing into a key partner for AI labs and companies working with large language models (LLMs).\\nToday, the startup collaborates with thousands of engineers to support AI development, helping build LLMs for OpenAI and others while creating generative AI applications for enterprises.\\nTuring’s AI Business\\nTuring has expanded its focus into two key areas, each playing a distinct role in shaping the future of AI.\\nThe first, Turing AGI Advancement, collaborates with leading AI labs to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence. The company works to refine AI models’ ability to think, reason, code, and adapt to complex tasks. Its efforts extend into areas like agentic behavior, multimodal processing, STEM knowledge, and other advanced capabilities that define next-generation AI.\\nThe second, Turing Intelligence, takes these advancements and turns them into practical solutions for businesses. By leveraging the latest breakthroughs, Turing helps Fortune 500 companies integrate AI into their operations, developing applications that address real-world challenges and drive efficiency.\\nTogether, these two divisions position Turing at the forefront of both AI research and enterprise adoption, ensuring that technological progress translates into tangible impact.\\nThe company relies on ALAN, its fine-tuning and reinforcement learning platform, which helps optimize AI model evaluations, training, and development. This approach allows Turing to improve AI systems while benefiting from the technology it helps create.\\nBetting on AI’s Future\\nAs AI companies push for smarter, more capable models, the demand for high-quality training data is surging. At the same time, lower inference costs and improvements in AI accessibility are making adoption easier for businesses. Turing is positioning itself at the intersection of these trends, working to advance AI models while turning that research into tools companies can actually use.\\n“Our goal is to accelerate AGI advancement and build AI systems with real-world impact,” said Jonathan Siddharth. “We’ve built a suite of products on top of the world’s largest talent cloud to improve AI models and deploy applications at scale. This Series E round underscores the confidence our investors have in our role in shaping the future of AI.”\\nTuring’s rise in the AI industry hasn’t gone unnoticed. The company has gained recognition from some of the most influential business and tech publications.\\nForbes named Turing one of America’s Best Startup Employers. The Information included it in its annual list of Most Promising B2B Companies. Fast Company also recognized Turing as one of the World’s Most Innovative Companies. These industry acknowledgments mark the company’s expanding presence in AI and enterprise technology.\\nThe leadership team includes AI technologists from Meta, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Twitter, McKinsey, Bain, Stanford, Caltech, and MIT.\\nWith this latest funding, Turing is ramping up efforts across AI research and enterprise adoption, securing its place as a key player in the AI industry.\\n🚀 Want Your Story Featured?\\nGet in front of thousands of founders, investors, PE firms, tech executives, decision makers, and tech readers by submitting your story to TechStartups.com.\\nGet Featured\\n0\\nShares\\n\\nShare On Facebook\\nTweet It\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTrending Now\\n\\nAmazon plans to lay off 14,000 managerial positions to save $3.5 billion annually\\nNickie Louise March 17, 2025\\n\\nMicrosoft is reportedly plotting a future without OpenAI\\nNickie Louise March 7, 2025\\n- Advertisement -\\n\\nRead Next\\nPOPG Expands Its Reach: $POPG Now Available on LBank\\n\\n\\nApps\\nGaming\\nStartups\\nStartup Fundings\\nTech News\\nCryptocurrency\\nCybersecurity\\nEmerging Technologies\\nProduct Reviews\\n\\nMore...\\n\\n\\n\\nYou are reading\\nTuring raises $111M in funding to accelerate AGI advancement, hits $2.2B valuation\\nShare No Comment\\n\\n\\n\\n© Copyright TechStartups.com 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPress enter/return to begin your search'}, 'https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/06/turing-a-key-coding-provider-for-openai-and-other-llm-producers-raises-111m-at-a-2-2b-valuation/': {'title': 'Turing Stock Price, Funding, Valuation, Revenue & Financial Statements', 'content': \"Funding, Valuation & Revenue. 12 Fundings.

Turing, which works with armies of engineers to contribute code to AI projects — including assisting in the building of LLMs for OpenAI and others, as well as creating generative AI apps for enterprises — has secured a $111 million Series E round, doubling its valuation to $2.2 billion.\\nTuring currently generates around $300 million in ARR (annualized revenue run rate), and when this latest round was priced, it stood at $167 million. That means the company is growing fast. It has also been profitable for around a year, according to CEO Jonathan Siddharth, who tells TechCrunch the company plans to use the funding to expand its business to more customers and broaden its use cases.\\nTuring today says that it works with some 4 million coders around the world. The actual number of Turing employees is much smaller — it’s a figure in the hundreds, one of its investors said.\\nMalaysia’s sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Berhad is leading the new round, with participation also from WestBridge Capital, Sozo Ventures, UpHonest Capital, AltaIR Capital, Amino Capital, Plug and Play, MVP Ventures, Fortius Ventures, Gaingels, and Mastodon Capital Management. Palo Alto-based Turing has raised $225 million to date.\\nTuring’s turn as a major partner to AI companies was not how the company got its start. Originally, it was effectively an HR tech startup.\\nSpecifically, its early product was a platform for vetting and hiring remote coders, a business that started to take off during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the world sought better tools to source and manage remote teams. That business was strong enough to catapult the company to “unicorn” status, impressing both customers and investors.\\n“When I first met them in 2018 my jaw dropped,” Sumir Chadha, a co-founder and managing partner at WestBridge, said in an interview, referring to how Siddharth seemingly upended the whole management consultancy and offshoring model. “You don’t need any of that. You don’t even need an HR staff. You can do it all with Turing and remote engineers.”\\nIt was also strong enough to start catching a different kind of attention.\\nAs a Semafor report from last year recounts, Siddharth was summoned in 2022 to OpenAI for a meeting, which he thought would be to talk about recruiting engineers for the startup. Instead, it turned out to be a proposition. OpenAI researchers had discovered that code added into training datasets helped improve the model’s reasoning capabilities, and it wanted Turing’s help to generate that code.\\nSiddharth obliged and that set off a whole new business focus for the startup, which he says now works with a number of foundational AI companies to provide similar services, as well as with companies that build apps on top of those LLMs.\\n“We could not have predicted the ChatGPT moment,” he said this week, and he couldn’t have predicted how the infrastructure he built for hiring coders would place Turing itself into the middle of the action. “I don’t think people knew how important software engineering tokens [would be] to teach an LLM to think and reason and code.”\\nBut it hasn’t been a pivot. Siddharth was quick to correct me when I used the word, and he pointed out that Turing still generates substantial revenue from its older business sourcing coding talent, although he would not disclose how much.\\n“They are all growing,” he said of the different business lines. “We are stepping on the gas to scale up R&D, and scale up sales and marketing across all three businesses. We are in rapid expansion mode.”\\nHowever, the main focus in terms of new business, it seems, will be to continue doubling down on its work in AI as a coding provider for the building of future LLMs — a division Turing optimistically calls “Turing AGI Advancement” — and in its work on apps and services built on those LLMs — under the banner of “Turing Intelligence.”\\nUpdated to include a more recent ARR figure.\\nTopics\\nAI, coding assistant, Fundraising, Khazanah Nasional Berhad, LLMs, OpenAI, Startups, turing\\n\\n\\nIngrid Lunden\\nEurope Editor\\n\\nIngrid is a writer and editor for TechCrunch, joining February 2012, based out of London.\\nBefore TechCrunch, Ingrid worked at paidContent.org, where she was a staff writer, and has in the past also written freelance regularly for other publications such as the Financial Times.

Turing’s customer base includes the world’s leading AI labs and Fortune 500 companies across a broad range of verticals including high tech, banking & financial services, retail, and healthcare.\\nTo build on this growth, Turing is advancing its capabilities to evaluate frontier models and improve model performance for thinking, advanced reasoning, coding, math, STEM and other forms of frontier knowledge. The company also is helping enterprises unlock the full capability of these models by building powerful AI systems and applications on top of these models to automate and augment a variety of business workflows. Turing recently added to its world class leadership roster to support this expansion.\\n\"We’ve gone from $100 to $300 million in ARR in a single year, and we hit profitability,\" said Jonathan Siddharth, Turing’s Founder and CEO. \"2025 is the year of Agents, Advanced Reasoning and Multi-modality. Powerful AGI models need a massive amount of data to keep the scaling laws going and coding data is particularly key for AGI since coding and math are foundational for reasoning.\" Siddharth continued, \"Turing’s infrastructure includes the world’s largest human intelligence platform of 4 million+ developers, data scientists, STEM and Math professionals.\"\\nTuring has two main business lines: Turing AGI Advancement, which works with the leading AI labs to advance frontier model capabilities in thinking, reasoning, coding, agentic behavior, multimodality, STEM and frontier knowledge; and Turing Intelligence, which leverages learnings from advancing frontier AGI to build real-world AI systems that solve mission-critical priorities for Fortune 500 Companies and government institutions.\\nTuring AGI Advancement has significantly expanded its LLM training capabilities and offers comprehensive model performance improvements across coding, advanced reasoning, multimodal reasoning, mathematics, STEM etc across public benchmarks and private evals. To support this growth, the company is deepening its talent pool with domain-specific experts, that include STEM PhDs, functional experts in sales, marketing, finance etc. and vertical experts across industries.\\nStory Continues\\nWith Turing Intelligence, the company delivered transformative AI applications across industries including banking and financial services, retail, food & beverages, and healthcare.

Turing, which works with armies of engineers to contribute code to AI projects — including assisting in the building of LLMs for OpenAI and others, as well as creating generative AI apps for enterprises — has secured a $111 million Series E round, doubling its valuation to $2.2 billion.\\nTuring currently generates around $300 million in ARR (annualized revenue run rate), and when this latest round was priced, it stood at $167 million. That means the company is growing fast. It has also been profitable for around a year, according to CEO Jonathan Siddharth, who tells TechCrunch the company plans to use the funding to expand its business to more customers and broaden its use cases.\\nTuring today says that it works with some 4 million coders around the world. The actual number of Turing employees is much smaller — it’s a figure in the hundreds, one of its investors said.\\nMalaysia’s sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Berhad is leading the new round, with participation also from WestBridge Capital, Sozo Ventures, UpHonest Capital, AltaIR Capital, Amino Capital, Plug and Play, MVP Ventures, Fortius Ventures, Gaingels, and Mastodon Capital Management. Palo Alto-based Turing has raised $225 million to date.\\nTuring’s turn as a major partner to AI companies was not how the company got its start. Originally, it was effectively an HR tech startup.\\nSpecifically, its early product was a platform for vetting and hiring remote coders, a business that started to take off during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the world sought better tools to source and manage remote teams. That business was strong enough to catapult the company to “unicorn” status, impressing both customers and investors.\\n“When I first met them in 2018 my jaw dropped,” Sumir Chadha, a co-founder and managing partner at WestBridge, said in an interview, referring to how Siddharth seemingly upended the whole management consultancy and offshoring model. “You don’t need any of that. You don’t even need an HR staff. You can do it all with Turing and remote engineers.”\\nIt was also strong enough to start catching a different kind of attention.\\nAs a Semafor report from last year recounts, Siddharth was summoned in 2022 to OpenAI for a meeting, which he thought would be to talk about recruiting engineers for the startup. Instead, it turned out to be a proposition. OpenAI researchers had discovered that code added into training datasets helped improve the model’s reasoning capabilities, and it wanted Turing’s help to generate that code.\\nSiddharth obliged and that set off a whole new business focus for the startup, which he says now works with a number of foundational AI companies to provide similar services, as well as with companies that build apps on top of those LLMs.\\n“We could not have predicted the ChatGPT moment,” he said this week, and he couldn’t have predicted how the infrastructure he built for hiring coders would place Turing itself into the middle of the action. “I don’t think people knew how important software engineering tokens [would be] to teach an LLM to think and reason and code.”\\nBut it hasn’t been a pivot. Siddharth was quick to correct me when I used the word, and he pointed out that Turing still generates substantial revenue from its older business sourcing coding talent, although he would not disclose how much.\\n“They are all growing,” he said of the different business lines. “We are stepping on the gas to scale up R&D, and scale up sales and marketing across all three businesses.

Hire 7x faster →\\n\\n\\n\\nHow to Choose the Best Platform for Your Needs\\n\\nChoosing the right platform is key to finding the best talent for your project. Here are some simple tips to help you pick one that fits your technical needs and supports your team’s growth:\\n\\n1. Define What You Need\\n\\nStart by clearly outlining your project requirements. Think about the programming languages, tools, and skills that are essential. Do you need a front-end developer, a back-end expert, or both? Decide what level of experience and soft skills are important to you. This will help you narrow down your options.\\n\\n2. Consider Your Budget\\n\\nCompare the costs of different platforms and see how they fit your budget. Some offer premium talent at a higher price, while others are more affordable. Make sure you understand if there are any upfront costs or long-term commitments. Check how payments are structured—whether they charge hourly or per project. Also, consider if the platform's pricing can scale as your project grows.\\n\\n3. Decide on the Scope\\n\\nThink about whether you need a single developer or a whole team. If you’re working on smaller updates or need specific expertise, an individual might be enough. But for more complex projects, like building enterprise-level software or AI systems, you may need a full team, including designers, project managers, and testers.\\n\\n4. Evaluate Flexibility\\n\\nFlexibility is important. Choose a platform that matches the duration of your project. Do you need someone for a few weeks or a long-term team? Check if you can easily adjust or cancel contracts without penalties. If your project grows, make sure the platform can quickly add more talent or scale from a single developer to a full team.\\n\\n5. Check Security and IP Protection\\n\\nMake sure your ideas and code are safe. Look for platforms that take security seriously, using encryption and strong access controls. Ensure they comply with standards like GDPR or ISO. Developers should also sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to protect your project. Once your project is done, all the code and designs should belong to you, not the platform.\\n\\n6. Assess Communication and Time Zones\\n\\nGood communication is key to a smooth project. Make sure the developers or teams are in time zones that allow for real-time collaboration. Check if the platform supports communication tools like Slack or Zoom. Ensure there’s enough overlap in work hours so that any issues or changes can be addressed quickly.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhich Alternative Best Fits You?\\n\\nAs demonstrated, each of the above-mentioned platforms offers distinct features suitable for different requirements. Based on your needs, you may want to consider the following options:\\n\\nRead more:\\xa0How Index.dev helped Omio hire full-stack Java developers in a hyper-competitive talent market\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can also try\\xa0Index.dev to access a global network of thoroughly vetted remote developers:\\n\\n🤖 Access to 15,000 thoroughly vetted developers, designers, PMs, and QAs\\n\\n🤖 Ready to interview candidates who are available to start immediately\\n\\n🤖 Full-time and long-term contractors tested and proven for remote work performance\\n\\nHire developers risk-free right now.

The company\\'s Imagine-Deliver-Run (IDR) framework provides complete, end-to-end solutions in the uptake, implementation, and management of AI, cloud computing, and application engineering, tailored to meet the specific tech talent and innovation demands of modern enterprises.\\nApplied and honed within its own business operations over the last four years and evolved from the company\\'s Teams offering that provides entire technology teams vetted through its AI-powered Talent Cloud, Turing\\'s IDR methodology was a central factor in the company\\'s triple-digit YoY growth in 2022. In addition to successfully applying the new framework to its own business, Turing applied its IDR approach with several leading companies across AI, healthcare, financial services, and software & hardware services, to solve a range of complex technical challenges with unmatched speed, quality, and cost-efficiency. Case studies demonstrating the success of Turing Services can be found at\\xa0https://www.turing.com/services.\\nTuring Services provides a framework for solution success across the following practice areas\\nArtificial Intelligence\\xa0Help enterprises leverage AI to transform their businessesCloud ComputingBuild, operate, manage, and maintain optimal cloud environmentApplication EngineeringDesign, prototype, and produce the ideal application-Implementation-Strategy & Readiness-Portfolio RationalizationStrategy-Platform Assessment-Assessment-Data Engineering-Migration-Modernization & Migration-ML Model-FoundationAssessment-Development-Security-Design-ML Operations-Cloud-Native Application-Web & Mobile Development\\xa0Development-CX/UI/UX Development\\xa0-DevOps Implementation-Maintenance & Support\\xa0-Platform Maintenance\\xa0\\n\"Conventional technology services fall short of meeting the speed, quality, and overall cost-efficiency requirements of today\\'s fiercely competitive business landscape, which has been further compounded by cutbacks, budgetary constraints, and the incessant shortage of high-caliber tech talent,\" said Jonathan Siddharth, Turing\\'s CEO and Co-Founder. \"With Turing Services, we have introduced an AI-powered approach that offers the best engineering team, vetted and matched by AI, for a company\\'s product roadmap. Our solutions experts have a proven track record of scaling some of today\\'s most iconic technology companies. Our official launch of Turing Services represents a significant advancement over antiquated services models and a new age in tech consulting.\"\\nThe launch of Turing Services comes on the heels of Turing\\'s successful 2022, a year in which the company experienced triple-digit YoY growth and the build-out of its world-class executive roster, while numerous tech companies were hampered by financial constraints, slowed growth, and a focus on business continuity versus innovation. Turing also recently announced the hiring of David Wei, formerly Vice President of Engineering at Meta, to head the company\\'s engineering and AI team which also includes Omkar Dalal, Head of Data Science & Analytics, who was previously Director of AI at LinkedIn. With the launch of Turing Services, the company is set to further accelerate innovation for its clients and continue its high growth trajectory.\\nABOUT TURING\\nTuring\\xa0is an AI-powered technology company that is disrupting the traditional tech consulting services landscape. Turing\\'s Intelligent Talent Cloud provides deeply vetted software development teams, matched by AI, to some of the world\\'s leading companies across a broad range of industries, including AI, automotive, entertainment, financial services, food & beverage, healthcare, social media, software & hardware services, food & beverage, and entertainment.

In great company with the likes of Asana, Atlassian, Gitlab, Slack, and Zoom, Turing defines itself as an international hiring platform that brings together remote software developers and leverages their unique AI vetting process to match the right teams with projects.\\nI met with Jonathan Siddharth, founder and CEO of Turing, to dive into his AI-powered tech services platform and his vision to unleash the world’s untapped human potential.\\nWhat catalyzed the birth of Turing came from the realization that traditional tech service firms were ill-equipped for the AI-driven era. Companies like Accenture continue to do manual sourcing, vetting of talent, manual matching. Turing is changing all this. According to Siddharth,\\n“We believe AI transformation is the new digital transformation. Every company is going to have to be an AI company and I\\'m sure you\\'re hearing the same where every company now needs an AI strategy. Every product is now an AI product. Every role is being transformed by AI. At Turing, we started the company because traditional tech services firms were simply not built for this. They continue to lack the efficiency that AI can bring. Turing is tech services reimagined from the ground up as an AI company. So, we asked ourselves, what would an AI powered Accenture look like?”\\nPROMOTED\\nIn 2020, at a time when the Pandemic mandated the move to remote work, Turing raised $32million in Series B funding with an ambitious plan to “help define the future of how companies source IT talent to grow.” Since 2018, the company has amassed a database of over 2 million engineers from over 150 countries with “approximately 100 or so engineering skills, including React, Node, Python, Agular, Swift, Android, Java, Rails, Golang, PHP, Vue, DevOps, machine learning, data engineering and more.”\\nSiddharth described how they uniquely transform and deliver this AI-powered Accenture. They leverage AI to autonomously identify, evaluate, and align suitable talent with corresponding opportunities. Secondly, they built Turing GPT, to accelerate the productivity of a software engineering team. As per Siddharth, “We combined that with our team of AI transformation experts who help companies in their transformation journey.” With a client list like Disney, Pepsi, Dell, Reddit, Volvo and Rivian, they can leverage Turing’s pre-vetted engineering talent for 1) staff augmentation, 2) custom projects designed to meet temporal requirements 3) and AI advisory services to assists companies in shaping their AI strategy and roadmap.\\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR\\n\\nBest Travel Insurance Companies\\nBy Amy Danise, Editor\\n\\nBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance Plans\\nBy Amy Danise, Editor\\nThese operations are built over top of the Turing Talent Cloud—an expansive pool of over two million developers and growing, they claim as the world’s largest developer- focused database. This resource pool, combined with AI algorithms, streamlines the process of talent acquisition—sourcing, vetting, and aligning them with the right companies.\\nDailyDozen\\nUS\\nForbes Daily: Join over 1 million Forbes Daily subscribers and get our best stories, exclusive reporting and essential analysis of the day’s news in your inbox every weekday.\\nSign Up\\nBy signing up, you agree to receive this newsletter, other updates about Forbes and its affiliates’ offerings, our Terms of Service (including resolving disputes on an individual basis via arbitration), and you acknowledge our Privacy Statement.

Enjoy the Daily!\\nMore Newsletters\\nGrowing up in Chennai, India, Jonathan Siddharth\\'s affinity for innovation became evident early on. He shared, \"I was always fascinated by the ‘new’... I published my first research paper in AI when I was in my sophomore year, 2002. I wrote about using neural networks for self-driving cars.\" After finishing college, he continued his AI research and pursued his Ph.D. at Stanford, which was already ahead in Autonomous Driving. It was there that Siddharth crossed paths with his, now, cofounder, Vijay Krishan, CTO of Turing. “We both got bitten by the startup bug and we started company #1, which was an AI powered content recommendation company.”\\nThe Spark in Finding Talent Outside of Silicon Valley\\nFrom this experience, they found it difficult recruiting great engineering talent. At the time they were at the heart of Silicon Valley, in Palo Alto, where they were fighting for the same limited talent pool as Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and Facebook. Out of necessity, they looked beyond Silicon Valley’s caliber of talent. “It was one of the best things we did”. That was 2012 and it was a move that demonstrated the potential for remote work long before it would bring to bear in 2020. “We were fortunate to work with some wonderful engineers from Poland, Canada, India, China and other parts of the world. And that was really the key to making the company successful. So, my first startup succeeded because of remote work in distributed teams.”\\nFollowing the acquisition of his first venture, Siddharth reflected on the persistent challenge they had conquered. \"Afterwards, I took some time off to figure out what do next, and it became clear that this problem that we had solved for ourselves in my first startup was such a big unsolved opportunity.\"\\nThis realization laid the foundation for the inception of Turing in 2018, with the goal of building this AI powered tech services company “where both Fortune 500 companies as well as startups could push a button to spin up their engineering team instantly.”\\nReflecting on Turing\\'s trajectory, Jonathan acknowledged the factors that have propelled the company\\'s growth. \"With AI being used for automatically vetting engineering talent, matching them, we are thinking about ways to use AI to increase the productivity of a software engineering team. I just feel fortunate that Turing benefited from 2 tailwinds. The first was the tailwinds around remote work and now it\\'s the tailwinds around AI.\\nOptimizing Engineering Teams: Turing\\'s Paradigm of Flexibility and Efficiency\\nTo be clear, Turing is not a recruiting company. The database of engineers are contractors loaned out for staffing or project needs. Does Siddharth believe there is a market to place typically higher-demanded software engineers for temporary projects vs. allowing companies to hire them outright?\\nSiddharth sees a shift in demand today, \"So, my view is that the best way to build a tech company today is for 20 to 40% of your engineering headcount to be powered by long-term full-time contractors like from a platform like Turing. I wouldn\\'t say you should do that for 100% of your engineering headcount, but 20 to 40% and there are some studies that say that it should maybe even be 50%.\"\\nHe highlighted the importance of speed and flexibility and the advantages from Turing’s approach: \"Imagine you were building an AI company like a Copilot for example. Let\\'s say you wanted to build like an iPhone app and Android app and a web app. Now, the old way of doing that would mean you have a budget for one engineer... that would build all three in sequence.\"\\nHe explained there is a better way that provides an organization exactly what they need: “But you don\\'t have to do that anymore. You could come to Turing and say, \\'I\\'m going to need to launch this on iOS, Android and the web.’ So, you\\'ll take three engineers from Turing\\'s talent cloud. They’ll building all three in parallel.\"\\nThis speed to market advantage allows the organization to apply resources only where they’re needed. Assume that once all three applications have been launched and the company decides the iOS app has achieved product market fit, therefore they will move more resources towards further developing that product with a backend engineer and simultaneously, wind down development on the web and Android app. This exemplifies the agility that Turing provides to scale up and scale down engineering teams as easily, effectively foregoing the cost of hiring, training and firing if they were to be employed directly by the organization.\\nSiddharth elaborated on their recent growth and their trajectory:\\nWith their most recent funding round, Turing has secured a valuation cap of four billion dollars. Their prior funding round resulted in a post valuation of 1.1 billion dollars. Cumulatively, Turing has raised approximately 144 million dollars and has achieved unicorn status.\\nSiddharth explains these funds are earmarked primarily for expansion in enhancing their AI-powered vetting and matching engine, with a concentrated effort on research and development. An upcoming endeavor is the development of an AI-powered self-service system that allows individuals to construct their engineering teams through interactive consultations with Turing.\\nSiddharth describes the company’s impact: \"The Turing team functions as a unit supercharged by an AI-powered exoskeleton.” With further sales and marketing efforts they are poised to build this AI-powered Accenture and take on their rival which has had the benefit of tenure and success.\\nReflecting on the Engineering of the Future\\nThe changing landscape for technology towards general AI will emerge the need for engineers to learn new languages and to adapt to disruptive environments that will reveal themselves in greater frequency. What will the role of the engineer look like in the next decade?\\nSiddharth responded with enthusiasm, stating, \"Absolutely, there has never been a more opportune time to pursue a career in software engineering or computer science.\" He suggested that computer science and AI education should be incorporated at the middle school level, alongside subjects like English and mathematics and advocated for introducing AI education at this stage given its growing relevance.\\nSiddharth emphasized a significant shift in the value proposition for software engineers. \"The return on investment (ROI) for becoming a software engineer has now multiplied by 10,\" he asserted. He attributed this dramatic increase to the projected 10-fold boost in software engineers\\' productivity. This expected surge in productivity, according to Siddharth, will pave the way for a surge in entrepreneurial endeavors over the coming years.\\nReflecting on the evolution of the startup, Siddharth recalled that a decade ago, startups often required a seasoned and skilled engineer alongside business experts. However, contemporary technological advancements such as AI-assisted tools enable a broader range of professionals to initiate startups. “Let\\'s say there is a talented journalist. She could start her AI company standing on the shoulders of some of these AI assisted tools.”\\nHe foresees an accelerated growth path for junior engineers, positing that they could attain mid-level engineer proficiency in a shorter span. \"Our head of engineering feels a mid-level engineer can now operate at the level of a senior engineer. AI is just going to amplify the productivity of everyone, and the key to all of this is everyone learning AI.”\\nSiddharth emphasized the importance of widespread AI education. He advocated for individuals acquiring at least a basic understanding of AI, as it is becoming a requisite for almost every job. He envisaged a future where AI integration is ubiquitous and diverse roles are infused with AI elements.\\nAnticipating the growth of AI\\'s potential, Siddharth expressed excitement about the continuous advancement of AI tools. He cited Turing\\'s own experience, noting a 30% increase in productivity using AI-accelerated tools. Jonathan Siddharth is optimistic as he looks forward to the transformative possibilities that AI holds for industries and professions.\\nOnly time will tell whether the broader enterprise market is ready to move towards the newly built Turing paradigm. In the meantime, this company has slowly paved the way to streamline the process of talent discovery, evaluation and alignment that has the potential to reimagine the power of remote engineering teams.\\nFollow me on\\xa0LinkedIn.\\xa0Check out\\xa0my\\xa0website or some of my other work.\\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades\\nJoin The Conversation\\nComments\\n0\\nOne Community.

This latest round pushes the company’s total funding to $225 million since it was founded seven years ago.\\nTuring has been on a strong growth trajectory, hitting $167 million in annualized revenue run rate (ARR) at the time of pricing. The company is now bringing in around $300 million in ARR and has been profitable for about a year, according to CEO Jonathan Siddharth. The funding will help scale R&D, sales, and marketing as the company looks to expand its reach and offerings.\\nFrom HR Tech to AI Partner\\nFounded in 2018, Turing started out as an HR tech company, building a platform to vet and hire remote engineers. The service took off during the pandemic when companies scrambled for better ways to manage remote teams. It didn’t take long for Turing to gain attention, attracting both investors and enterprise clients.\\nThe shift into AI wasn’t part of the original plan, but an unexpected meeting in 2022 changed that. OpenAI invited Siddharth to discuss recruiting engineers, but instead, they had a different proposition. Researchers had discovered that code integrated into training datasets helped improve reasoning in AI models, and they wanted Turing to help generate that data. That request sparked a new business line, turning Turing into a key partner for AI labs and companies working with large language models (LLMs).\\nToday, the startup collaborates with thousands of engineers to support AI development, helping build LLMs for OpenAI and others while creating generative AI applications for enterprises.\\nTuring’s AI Business\\nTuring has expanded its focus into two key areas, each playing a distinct role in shaping the future of AI.\\nThe first, Turing AGI Advancement, collaborates with leading AI labs to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence. The company works to refine AI models’ ability to think, reason, code, and adapt to complex tasks. Its efforts extend into areas like agentic behavior, multimodal processing, STEM knowledge, and other advanced capabilities that define next-generation AI.\\nThe second, Turing Intelligence, takes these advancements and turns them into practical solutions for businesses. By leveraging the latest breakthroughs, Turing helps Fortune 500 companies integrate AI into their operations, developing applications that address real-world challenges and drive efficiency.\\nTogether, these two divisions position Turing at the forefront of both AI research and enterprise adoption, ensuring that technological progress translates into tangible impact.\\nThe company relies on ALAN, its fine-tuning and reinforcement learning platform, which helps optimize AI model evaluations, training, and development. This approach allows Turing to improve AI systems while benefiting from the technology it helps create.\\nBetting on AI’s Future\\nAs AI companies push for smarter, more capable models, the demand for high-quality training data is surging. At the same time, lower inference costs and improvements in AI accessibility are making adoption easier for businesses. Turing is positioning itself at the intersection of these trends, working to advance AI models while turning that research into tools companies can actually use.\\n“Our goal is to accelerate AGI advancement and build AI systems with real-world impact,” said Jonathan Siddharth. “We’ve built a suite of products on top of the world’s largest talent cloud to improve AI models and deploy applications at scale. This Series E round underscores the confidence our investors have in our role in shaping the future of AI.”\\nTuring’s rise in the AI industry hasn’t gone unnoticed. The company has gained recognition from some of the most influential business and tech publications.\\nForbes named Turing one of America’s Best Startup Employers. The Information included it in its annual list of Most Promising B2B Companies. Fast Company also recognized Turing as one of the World’s Most Innovative Companies. These industry acknowledgments mark the company’s expanding presence in AI and enterprise technology.\\nThe leadership team includes AI technologists from Meta, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Twitter, McKinsey, Bain, Stanford, Caltech, and MIT.\\nWith this latest funding, Turing is ramping up efforts across AI research and enterprise adoption, securing its place as a key player in the AI industry.\\n🚀 Want Your Story Featured?\\nGet in front of thousands of founders, investors, PE firms, tech executives, decision makers, and tech readers by submitting your story to TechStartups.com.\\nGet Featured\\n0\\nShares\\n\\nShare On Facebook\\nTweet It\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTrending Now\\n\\nAmazon plans to lay off 14,000 managerial positions to save $3.5 billion annually\\nNickie Louise March 17, 2025\\n\\nMicrosoft is reportedly plotting a future without OpenAI\\nNickie Louise March 7, 2025\\n- Advertisement -\\n\\nRead Next\\nPOPG Expands Its Reach: $POPG Now Available on LBank\\n\\n\\nApps\\nGaming\\nStartups\\nStartup Fundings\\nTech News\\nCryptocurrency\\nCybersecurity\\nEmerging Technologies\\nProduct Reviews\\n\\nMore...\\n\\n\\n\\nYou are reading\\nTuring raises $111M in funding to accelerate AGI advancement, hits $2.2B valuation\\nShare No Comment\\n\\n\\n\\n© Copyright TechStartups.com 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPress enter/return to begin your search'}, 'https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/06/turing-a-key-coding-provider-for-openai-and-other-llm-producers-raises-111m-at-a-2-2b-valuation/': {'title': 'Turing Stock Price, Funding, Valuation, Revenue & Financial Statements', 'content': \"Funding, Valuation & Revenue. 12 Fundings.

Turing, which works with armies of engineers to contribute code to AI projects — including assisting in the building of LLMs for OpenAI and others, as well as creating generative AI apps for enterprises — has secured a $111 million Series E round, doubling its valuation to $2.2 billion.\\nTuring currently generates around $300 million in ARR (annualized revenue run rate), and when this latest round was priced, it stood at $167 million. That means the company is growing fast. It has also been profitable for around a year, according to CEO Jonathan Siddharth, who tells TechCrunch the company plans to use the funding to expand its business to more customers and broaden its use cases.\\nTuring today says that it works with some 4 million coders around the world. The actual number of Turing employees is much smaller — it’s a figure in the hundreds, one of its investors said.\\nMalaysia’s sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Berhad is leading the new round, with participation also from WestBridge Capital, Sozo Ventures, UpHonest Capital, AltaIR Capital, Amino Capital, Plug and Play, MVP Ventures, Fortius Ventures, Gaingels, and Mastodon Capital Management. Palo Alto-based Turing has raised $225 million to date.\\nTuring’s turn as a major partner to AI companies was not how the company got its start. Originally, it was effectively an HR tech startup.\\nSpecifically, its early product was a platform for vetting and hiring remote coders, a business that started to take off during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the world sought better tools to source and manage remote teams. That business was strong enough to catapult the company to “unicorn” status, impressing both customers and investors.\\n“When I first met them in 2018 my jaw dropped,” Sumir Chadha, a co-founder and managing partner at WestBridge, said in an interview, referring to how Siddharth seemingly upended the whole management consultancy and offshoring model. “You don’t need any of that. You don’t even need an HR staff. You can do it all with Turing and remote engineers.”\\nIt was also strong enough to start catching a different kind of attention.\\nAs a Semafor report from last year recounts, Siddharth was summoned in 2022 to OpenAI for a meeting, which he thought would be to talk about recruiting engineers for the startup. Instead, it turned out to be a proposition. OpenAI researchers had discovered that code added into training datasets helped improve the model’s reasoning capabilities, and it wanted Turing’s help to generate that code.\\nSiddharth obliged and that set off a whole new business focus for the startup, which he says now works with a number of foundational AI companies to provide similar services, as well as with companies that build apps on top of those LLMs.\\n“We could not have predicted the ChatGPT moment,” he said this week, and he couldn’t have predicted how the infrastructure he built for hiring coders would place Turing itself into the middle of the action. “I don’t think people knew how important software engineering tokens [would be] to teach an LLM to think and reason and code.”\\nBut it hasn’t been a pivot. Siddharth was quick to correct me when I used the word, and he pointed out that Turing still generates substantial revenue from its older business sourcing coding talent, although he would not disclose how much.\\n“They are all growing,” he said of the different business lines. “We are stepping on the gas to scale up R&D, and scale up sales and marketing across all three businesses. We are in rapid expansion mode.”\\nHowever, the main focus in terms of new business, it seems, will be to continue doubling down on its work in AI as a coding provider for the building of future LLMs — a division Turing optimistically calls “Turing AGI Advancement” — and in its work on apps and services built on those LLMs — under the banner of “Turing Intelligence.”\\nUpdated to include a more recent ARR figure.\\nTopics\\nAI, coding assistant, Fundraising, Khazanah Nasional Berhad, LLMs, OpenAI, Startups, turing\\n\\n\\nIngrid Lunden\\nEurope Editor\\n\\nIngrid is a writer and editor for TechCrunch, joining February 2012, based out of London.\\nBefore TechCrunch, Ingrid worked at paidContent.org, where she was a staff writer, and has in the past also written freelance regularly for other publications such as the Financial Times.

Turing’s customer base includes the world’s leading AI labs and Fortune 500 companies across a broad range of verticals including high tech, banking & financial services, retail, and healthcare.\\nTo build on this growth, Turing is advancing its capabilities to evaluate frontier models and improve model performance for thinking, advanced reasoning, coding, math, STEM and other forms of frontier knowledge. The company also is helping enterprises unlock the full capability of these models by building powerful AI systems and applications on top of these models to automate and augment a variety of business workflows. Turing recently added to its world class leadership roster to support this expansion.\\n\"We’ve gone from $100 to $300 million in ARR in a single year, and we hit profitability,\" said Jonathan Siddharth, Turing’s Founder and CEO. \"2025 is the year of Agents, Advanced Reasoning and Multi-modality. Powerful AGI models need a massive amount of data to keep the scaling laws going and coding data is particularly key for AGI since coding and math are foundational for reasoning.\" Siddharth continued, \"Turing’s infrastructure includes the world’s largest human intelligence platform of 4 million+ developers, data scientists, STEM and Math professionals.\"\\nTuring has two main business lines: Turing AGI Advancement, which works with the leading AI labs to advance frontier model capabilities in thinking, reasoning, coding, agentic behavior, multimodality, STEM and frontier knowledge; and Turing Intelligence, which leverages learnings from advancing frontier AGI to build real-world AI systems that solve mission-critical priorities for Fortune 500 Companies and government institutions.\\nTuring AGI Advancement has significantly expanded its LLM training capabilities and offers comprehensive model performance improvements across coding, advanced reasoning, multimodal reasoning, mathematics, STEM etc across public benchmarks and private evals.

Turing, which works with armies of engineers to contribute code to AI projects — including assisting in the building of LLMs for OpenAI and others, as well as creating generative AI apps for enterprises — has secured a $111 million Series E round, doubling its valuation to $2.2 billion.\\nTuring currently generates around $300 million in ARR (annualized revenue run rate), and when this latest round was priced, it stood at $167 million. That means the company is growing fast. It has also been profitable for around a year, according to CEO Jonathan Siddharth, who tells TechCrunch the company plans to use the funding to expand its business to more customers and broaden its use cases.\\nTuring today says that it works with some 4 million coders around the world. The actual number of Turing employees is much smaller — it’s a figure in the hundreds, one of its investors said.\\nMalaysia’s sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Berhad is leading the new round, with participation also from WestBridge Capital, Sozo Ventures, UpHonest Capital, AltaIR Capital, Amino Capital, Plug and Play, MVP Ventures, Fortius Ventures, Gaingels, and Mastodon Capital Management. Palo Alto-based Turing has raised $225 million to date.\\nTuring’s turn as a major partner to AI companies was not how the company got its start. Originally, it was effectively an HR tech startup.\\nSpecifically, its early product was a platform for vetting and hiring remote coders, a business that started to take off during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the world sought better tools to source and manage remote teams. That business was strong enough to catapult the company to “unicorn” status, impressing both customers and investors.\\n“When I first met them in 2018 my jaw dropped,” Sumir Chadha, a co-founder and managing partner at WestBridge, said in an interview, referring to how Siddharth seemingly upended the whole management consultancy and offshoring model. “You don’t need any of that. You don’t even need an HR staff. You can do it all with Turing and remote engineers.”\\nIt was also strong enough to start catching a different kind of attention.\\nAs a Semafor report from last year recounts, Siddharth was summoned in 2022 to OpenAI for a meeting, which he thought would be to talk about recruiting engineers for the startup. Instead, it turned out to be a proposition. OpenAI researchers had discovered that code added into training datasets helped improve the model’s reasoning capabilities, and it wanted Turing’s help to generate that code.\\nSiddharth obliged and that set off a whole new business focus for the startup, which he says now works with a number of foundational AI companies to provide similar services, as well as with companies that build apps on top of those LLMs.\\n“We could not have predicted the ChatGPT moment,” he said this week, and he couldn’t have predicted how the infrastructure he built for hiring coders would place Turing itself into the middle of the action. “I don’t think people knew how important software engineering tokens [would be] to teach an LLM to think and reason and code.”\\nBut it hasn’t been a pivot. Siddharth was quick to correct me when I used the word, and he pointed out that Turing still generates substantial revenue from its older business sourcing coding talent, although he would not disclose how much.\\n“They are all growing,” he said of the different business lines. “We are stepping on the gas to scale up R&D, and scale up sales and marketing across all three businesses. We are in rapid expansion mode.”\\nHowever, the main focus in terms of new business, it seems, will be to continue doubling down on its work in AI as a coding provider for the building of future LLMs — a division Turing optimistically calls “Turing AGI Advancement” — and in its work on apps and services built on those LLMs — under the banner of “Turing Intelligence.”\\nUpdated to include a more recent ARR figure.\\nTopics\\nAI, coding assistant, Fundraising, Khazanah Nasional Berhad, LLMs, OpenAI, Startups, turing\\n\\n\\nIngrid Lunden\\nEurope Editor\\n\\nIngrid is a writer and editor for TechCrunch, joining February 2012, based out of London.\\nBefore TechCrunch, Ingrid worked at paidContent.org, where she was a staff writer, and has in the past also written freelance regularly for other publications such as the Financial Times.

Index.dev has you covered. We offer a global talent network of 14,000 vetted engineering talent, ready to join your team. Hire 7x faster →\\n\\n\\n\\nHow to Choose the Best Platform for Your Needs\\n\\nChoosing the right platform is key to finding the best talent for your project. Here are some simple tips to help you pick one that fits your technical needs and supports your team’s growth:\\n\\n1. Define What You Need\\n\\nStart by clearly outlining your project requirements. Think about the programming languages, tools, and skills that are essential. Do you need a front-end developer, a back-end expert, or both? Decide what level of experience and soft skills are important to you. This will help you narrow down your options.\\n\\n2. Consider Your Budget\\n\\nCompare the costs of different platforms and see how they fit your budget. Some offer premium talent at a higher price, while others are more affordable. Make sure you understand if there are any upfront costs or long-term commitments. Check how payments are structured—whether they charge hourly or per project. Also, consider if the platform's pricing can scale as your project grows.\\n\\n3. Decide on the Scope\\n\\nThink about whether you need a single developer or a whole team. If you’re working on smaller updates or need specific expertise, an individual might be enough. But for more complex projects, like building enterprise-level software or AI systems, you may need a full team, including designers, project managers, and testers.\\n\\n4. Evaluate Flexibility\\n\\nFlexibility is important. Choose a platform that matches the duration of your project. Do you need someone for a few weeks or a long-term team? Check if you can easily adjust or cancel contracts without penalties. If your project grows, make sure the platform can quickly add more talent or scale from a single developer to a full team.\\n\\n5. Check Security and IP Protection\\n\\nMake sure your ideas and code are safe. Look for platforms that take security seriously, using encryption and strong access controls. Ensure they comply with standards like GDPR or ISO. Developers should also sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to protect your project. Once your project is done, all the code and designs should belong to you, not the platform.\\n\\n6. Assess Communication and Time Zones\\n\\nGood communication is key to a smooth project. Make sure the developers or teams are in time zones that allow for real-time collaboration. Check if the platform supports communication tools like Slack or Zoom. Ensure there’s enough overlap in work hours so that any issues or changes can be addressed quickly.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhich Alternative Best Fits You?\\n\\nAs demonstrated, each of the above-mentioned platforms offers distinct features suitable for different requirements. Based on your needs, you may want to consider the following options:\\n\\nRead more:\\xa0How Index.dev helped Omio hire full-stack Java developers in a hyper-competitive talent market\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can also try\\xa0Index.dev to access a global network of thoroughly vetted remote developers:\\n\\n🤖 Access to 15,000 thoroughly vetted developers, designers, PMs, and QAs\\n\\n🤖 Ready to interview candidates who are available to start immediately\\n\\n🤖 Full-time and long-term contractors tested and proven for remote work performance\\n\\nHire developers risk-free right now.

The company\\'s Imagine-Deliver-Run (IDR) framework provides complete, end-to-end solutions in the uptake, implementation, and management of AI, cloud computing, and application engineering, tailored to meet the specific tech talent and innovation demands of modern enterprises.\\nApplied and honed within its own business operations over the last four years and evolved from the company\\'s Teams offering that provides entire technology teams vetted through its AI-powered Talent Cloud, Turing\\'s IDR methodology was a central factor in the company\\'s triple-digit YoY growth in 2022. In addition to successfully applying the new framework to its own business, Turing applied its IDR approach with several leading companies across AI, healthcare, financial services, and software & hardware services, to solve a range of complex technical challenges with unmatched speed, quality, and cost-efficiency. Case studies demonstrating the success of Turing Services can be found at\\xa0https://www.turing.com/services.\\nTuring Services provides a framework for solution success across the following practice areas\\nArtificial Intelligence\\xa0Help enterprises leverage AI to transform their businessesCloud ComputingBuild, operate, manage, and maintain optimal cloud environmentApplication EngineeringDesign, prototype, and produce the ideal application-Implementation-Strategy & Readiness-Portfolio RationalizationStrategy-Platform Assessment-Assessment-Data Engineering-Migration-Modernization & Migration-ML Model-FoundationAssessment-Development-Security-Design-ML Operations-Cloud-Native Application-Web & Mobile Development\\xa0Development-CX/UI/UX Development\\xa0-DevOps Implementation-Maintenance & Support\\xa0-Platform Maintenance\\xa0\\n\"Conventional technology services fall short of meeting the speed, quality, and overall cost-efficiency requirements of today\\'s fiercely competitive business landscape, which has been further compounded by cutbacks, budgetary constraints, and the incessant shortage of high-caliber tech talent,\" said Jonathan Siddharth, Turing\\'s CEO and Co-Founder. \"With Turing Services, we have introduced an AI-powered approach that offers the best engineering team, vetted and matched by AI, for a company\\'s product roadmap. Our solutions experts have a proven track record of scaling some of today\\'s most iconic technology companies. Our official launch of Turing Services represents a significant advancement over antiquated services models and a new age in tech consulting.\"\\nThe launch of Turing Services comes on the heels of Turing\\'s successful 2022, a year in which the company experienced triple-digit YoY growth and the build-out of its world-class executive roster, while numerous tech companies were hampered by financial constraints, slowed growth, and a focus on business continuity versus innovation. Turing also recently announced the hiring of David Wei, formerly Vice President of Engineering at Meta, to head the company\\'s engineering and AI team which also includes Omkar Dalal, Head of Data Science & Analytics, who was previously Director of AI at LinkedIn. With the launch of Turing Services, the company is set to further accelerate innovation for its clients and continue its high growth trajectory.\\nABOUT TURING\\nTuring\\xa0is an AI-powered technology company that is disrupting the traditional tech consulting services landscape. Turing\\'s Intelligent Talent Cloud provides deeply vetted software development teams, matched by AI, to some of the world\\'s leading companies across a broad range of industries, including AI, automotive, entertainment, financial services, food & beverage, healthcare, social media, software & hardware services, food & beverage, and entertainment.

In great company with the likes of Asana, Atlassian, Gitlab, Slack, and Zoom, Turing defines itself as an international hiring platform that brings together remote software developers and leverages their unique AI vetting process to match the right teams with projects.\\nI met with Jonathan Siddharth, founder and CEO of Turing, to dive into his AI-powered tech services platform and his vision to unleash the world’s untapped human potential.\\nWhat catalyzed the birth of Turing came from the realization that traditional tech service firms were ill-equipped for the AI-driven era. Companies like Accenture continue to do manual sourcing, vetting of talent, manual matching. Turing is changing all this. According to Siddharth,\\n“We believe AI transformation is the new digital transformation. Every company is going to have to be an AI company and I\\'m sure you\\'re hearing the same where every company now needs an AI strategy. Every product is now an AI product. Every role is being transformed by AI. At Turing, we started the company because traditional tech services firms were simply not built for this. They continue to lack the efficiency that AI can bring. Turing is tech services reimagined from the ground up as an AI company. So, we asked ourselves, what would an AI powered Accenture look like?”\\nPROMOTED\\nIn 2020, at a time when the Pandemic mandated the move to remote work, Turing raised $32million in Series B funding with an ambitious plan to “help define the future of how companies source IT talent to grow.” Since 2018, the company has amassed a database of over 2 million engineers from over 150 countries with “approximately 100 or so engineering skills, including React, Node, Python, Agular, Swift, Android, Java, Rails, Golang, PHP, Vue, DevOps, machine learning, data engineering and more.”\\nSiddharth described how they uniquely transform and deliver this AI-powered Accenture. They leverage AI to autonomously identify, evaluate, and align suitable talent with corresponding opportunities. Secondly, they built Turing GPT, to accelerate the productivity of a software engineering team. As per Siddharth, “We combined that with our team of AI transformation experts who help companies in their transformation journey.” With a client list like Disney, Pepsi, Dell, Reddit, Volvo and Rivian, they can leverage Turing’s pre-vetted engineering talent for 1) staff augmentation, 2) custom projects designed to meet temporal requirements 3) and AI advisory services to assists companies in shaping their AI strategy and roadmap.\\nMORE FROM FORBES ADVISOR\\n\\nBest Travel Insurance Companies\\nBy Amy Danise, Editor\\n\\nBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance Plans\\nBy Amy Danise, Editor\\nThese operations are built over top of the Turing Talent Cloud—an expansive pool of over two million developers and growing, they claim as the world’s largest developer- focused database. This resource pool, combined with AI algorithms, streamlines the process of talent acquisition—sourcing, vetting, and aligning them with the right companies.\\nDailyDozen\\nUS\\nForbes Daily: Join over 1 million Forbes Daily subscribers and get our best stories, exclusive reporting and essential analysis of the day’s news in your inbox every weekday.\\nSign Up\\nBy signing up, you agree to receive this newsletter, other updates about Forbes and its affiliates’ offerings, our Terms of Service (including resolving disputes on an individual basis via arbitration), and you acknowledge our Privacy Statement.

Enjoy the Daily!\\nMore Newsletters\\nGrowing up in Chennai, India, Jonathan Siddharth\\'s affinity for innovation became evident early on. He shared, \"I was always fascinated by the ‘new’... I published my first research paper in AI when I was in my sophomore year, 2002. I wrote about using neural networks for self-driving cars.\" After finishing college, he continued his AI research and pursued his Ph.D. at Stanford, which was already ahead in Autonomous Driving. It was there that Siddharth crossed paths with his, now, cofounder, Vijay Krishan, CTO of Turing. “We both got bitten by the startup bug and we started company #1, which was an AI powered content recommendation company.”\\nThe Spark in Finding Talent Outside of Silicon Valley\\nFrom this experience, they found it difficult recruiting great engineering talent. At the time they were at the heart of Silicon Valley, in Palo Alto, where they were fighting for the same limited talent pool as Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and Facebook. Out of necessity, they looked beyond Silicon Valley’s caliber of talent. “It was one of the best things we did”. That was 2012 and it was a move that demonstrated the potential for remote work long before it would bring to bear in 2020. “We were fortunate to work with some wonderful engineers from Poland, Canada, India, China and other parts of the world. And that was really the key to making the company successful. So, my first startup succeeded because of remote work in distributed teams.”\\nFollowing the acquisition of his first venture, Siddharth reflected on the persistent challenge they had conquered. \"Afterwards, I took some time off to figure out what do next, and it became clear that this problem that we had solved for ourselves in my first startup was such a big unsolved opportunity.\"\\nThis realization laid the foundation for the inception of Turing in 2018, with the goal of building this AI powered tech services company “where both Fortune 500 companies as well as startups could push a button to spin up their engineering team instantly.”\\nReflecting on Turing\\'s trajectory, Jonathan acknowledged the factors that have propelled the company\\'s growth. \"With AI being used for automatically vetting engineering talent, matching them, we are thinking about ways to use AI to increase the productivity of a software engineering team. I just feel fortunate that Turing benefited from 2 tailwinds. The first was the tailwinds around remote work and now it\\'s the tailwinds around AI.\\nOptimizing Engineering Teams: Turing\\'s Paradigm of Flexibility and Efficiency\\nTo be clear, Turing is not a recruiting company. The database of engineers are contractors loaned out for staffing or project needs. Does Siddharth believe there is a market to place typically higher-demanded software engineers for temporary projects vs. allowing companies to hire them outright?\\nSiddharth sees a shift in demand today, \"So, my view is that the best way to build a tech company today is for 20 to 40% of your engineering headcount to be powered by long-term full-time contractors like from a platform like Turing. I wouldn\\'t say you should do that for 100% of your engineering headcount, but 20 to 40% and there are some studies that say that it should maybe even be 50%.\"\\nHe highlighted the importance of speed and flexibility and the advantages from Turing’s approach: \"Imagine you were building an AI company like a Copilot for example. Let\\'s say you wanted to build like an iPhone app and Android app and a web app. Now, the old way of doing that would mean you have a budget for one engineer... that would build all three in sequence.\"\\nHe explained there is a better way that provides an organization exactly what they need: “But you don\\'t have to do that anymore. You could come to Turing and say, \\'I\\'m going to need to launch this on iOS, Android and the web.’ So, you\\'ll take three engineers from Turing\\'s talent cloud. They’ll building all three in parallel.\"\\nThis speed to market advantage allows the organization to apply resources only where they’re needed. Assume that once all three applications have been launched and the company decides the iOS app has achieved product market fit, therefore they will move more resources towards further developing that product with a backend engineer and simultaneously, wind down development on the web and Android app. This exemplifies the agility that Turing provides to scale up and scale down engineering teams as easily, effectively foregoing the cost of hiring, training and firing if they were to be employed directly by the organization.\\nSiddharth elaborated on their recent growth and their trajectory:\\nWith their most recent funding round, Turing has secured a valuation cap of four billion dollars. Their prior funding round resulted in a post valuation of 1.1 billion dollars. Cumulatively, Turing has raised approximately 144 million dollars and has achieved unicorn status.\\nSiddharth explains these funds are earmarked primarily for expansion in enhancing their AI-powered vetting and matching engine, with a concentrated effort on research and development. An upcoming endeavor is the development of an AI-powered self-service system that allows individuals to construct their engineering teams through interactive consultations with Turing.\\nSiddharth describes the company’s impact: \"The Turing team functions as a unit supercharged by an AI-powered exoskeleton.” With further sales and marketing efforts they are poised to build this AI-powered Accenture and take on their rival which has had the benefit of tenure and success.\\nReflecting on the Engineering of the Future\\nThe changing landscape for technology towards general AI will emerge the need for engineers to learn new languages and to adapt to disruptive environments that will reveal themselves in greater frequency. What will the role of the engineer look like in the next decade?\\nSiddharth responded with enthusiasm, stating, \"Absolutely, there has never been a more opportune time to pursue a career in software engineering or computer science.\" He suggested that computer science and AI education should be incorporated at the middle school level, alongside subjects like English and mathematics and advocated for introducing AI education at this stage given its growing relevance.\\nSiddharth emphasized a significant shift in the value proposition for software engineers. \"The return on investment (ROI) for becoming a software engineer has now multiplied by 10,\" he asserted. He attributed this dramatic increase to the projected 10-fold boost in software engineers\\' productivity. This expected surge in productivity, according to Siddharth, will pave the way for a surge in entrepreneurial endeavors over the coming years.\\nReflecting on the evolution of the startup, Siddharth recalled that a decade ago, startups often required a seasoned and skilled engineer alongside business experts. However, contemporary technological advancements such as AI-assisted tools enable a broader range of professionals to initiate startups. “Let\\'s say there is a talented journalist. She could start her AI company standing on the shoulders of some of these AI assisted tools.”\\nHe foresees an accelerated growth path for junior engineers, positing that they could attain mid-level engineer proficiency in a shorter span. \"Our head of engineering feels a mid-level engineer can now operate at the level of a senior engineer. AI is just going to amplify the productivity of everyone, and the key to all of this is everyone learning AI.”\\nSiddharth emphasized the importance of widespread AI education. He advocated for individuals acquiring at least a basic understanding of AI, as it is becoming a requisite for almost every job. He envisaged a future where AI integration is ubiquitous and diverse roles are infused with AI elements.\\nAnticipating the growth of AI\\'s potential, Siddharth expressed excitement about the continuous advancement of AI tools. He cited Turing\\'s own experience, noting a 30% increase in productivity using AI-accelerated tools. Jonathan Siddharth is optimistic as he looks forward to the transformative possibilities that AI holds for industries and professions.\\nOnly time will tell whether the broader enterprise market is ready to move towards the newly built Turing paradigm. In the meantime, this company has slowly paved the way to streamline the process of talent discovery, evaluation and alignment that has the potential to reimagine the power of remote engineering teams.\\nFollow me on\\xa0LinkedIn.\\xa0Check out\\xa0my\\xa0website or some of my other work.\\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades\\nJoin The Conversation\\nComments\\n0\\nOne Community.
